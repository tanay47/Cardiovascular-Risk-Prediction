# Cardiovascular-Risk-Prediction
Cardiovascular disease is a significant and ever-growing problem across the world, accounting for nearly one-third of all deaths and leading to significant morbidity. It is also of particular and pressing interest as developing countries experience a change in lifestyle which introduces novel risk factors for cardiovascular disease, leading to a boom in cardiovascular disease risk throughout the developing world. Everyone is aware how expensive, cumbersome and disturbing it is to suffer from any Cardiovascular disease. ### Our goal here is to build a ML model to predict if a patient shows any kind of suspicion or risk for Cardiovascular diseases with high level of accuracy given patients description.
